# NEMO: **N**ext **E**nergy **M**odeling system for **O**ptimization

NEMO is a high performance, open source energy system optimization tool developed in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).  It is intended for modelers who seek substantial optimization capabilities without the limitations of proprietary, fee-based software and the performance bottlenecks of common open source alternatives. Key features of NEMO include:

- Least-cost optimization of energy supply and demand
- Support for multiple regions and regional trade
- Modeling of energy storage
- Modeling of emissions and emission constraints
- Modeling of renewable energy targets
- Parallel processing
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) data store

NEMO can be used in command-line mode by installing this Julia package, and it also being integrated with the [Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system (LEAP)](https://www.energycommunity.org/). This will allow LEAP to serve as a graphical user interface to NEMO.

# Getting started with NEMO

There are two ways to set up NEMO for command-line usage:

1. Manual installation
2. Automated installation

## Manual installation

This method is appropriate for experienced Julia users (or people who just want to know more about how NEMO is put together!). To install NEMO manually, follow these steps:
