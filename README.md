# NEMO: Next Energy Modeling system for Optimization

NEMO is a high performance, open source energy system optimization tool developed in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).  It is intended for modelers who seek substantial optimization capabilities without the limitations of proprietary, fee-based software and the performance bottlenecks of common open source alternatives. Key features of NEMO include:

- Least-cost optimization of energy supply and demand
- Support for multiple regions and regional trade
- Modeling of energy storage
- Modeling of emissions and emission constraints
- Modeling of renewable energy targets
- Parallel processing
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) data store

NEMO can be used in command-line mode by installing this Julia package, and it also being integrated with the [Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system (LEAP)](https://www.energycommunity.org/). This will allow LEAP to serve as a graphical user interface to NEMO.
